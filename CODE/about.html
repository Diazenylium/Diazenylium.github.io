    ABOUT THE VELOCIRAPTOR
  </h1>
  <p class="aboutintro">
    In order to properly comprehend the threat of a velociraptor, one must first understand the workings of the velociraptor itself. Here are some facts about and skills of the velociraptor.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Basic Facts
  </h2>

  <p class="facts">
    <i>Velociraptor</i> is the genus name of several species of dromaeosaurid dinosaur, the type of dinosaur that is most closely related to birds. Velociraptors are approximately 80 cm tall, and 2 m long, including tail. They usually have a mass of around 24 to 27 kg, although exceptional individuals have grown up to 35 kg.
  </p>
  <p class="facts">
    Being entirely feathered, and being about the size of a turkey, velociraptors give the overall impression of a very strange-looking bird. Flocks of velociraptors have been mistaken for wild game birds from afar, much to the dismay of the human watching them or, god forbid, mistakenly trying to hunt them.

    Hunting Techniques

  <p class="skills">
    A velociraptor has one three-inch-long claw on its hind foot and three curved claws on each of its forelimbs. While the velociraptor's claws are not sharp enough to fully disembowel a human, they are sufficient for stabbing and tearing open vital organs in the throat. The velociraptors know this, and the throat is where they will attack first if hunting.
  </p>
  <p class="skills">
    Their top speed is approximately 60 kph, or 37 mph, although they do not have much stamina and, similar to a cheetah, will exhaust their energy within a few minutes. Velociraptors can also jump up to 10 feet vertically. Your second story windows are not safe.
  </p>
  <p class="skills">
    Velociraptors, contrary to popular belief, are not pack hunters. They are sometimes solitary, usually hunting in groups of two or three at most. They are ambushers, preferring to surprise their prey by jumping onto them and slashing at their throat and abdomen, then leaving them to die from blood loss and organ failure.
