      ABOUT THE VELOCIRAPTOR
    </h1>
    <p class="aboutintro">
      In order to properly comprehend the threat of a velociraptor, one must first understand the workings of the velociraptor itself. Here are some facts about and skills of the velociraptor.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Basic Facts
    </h2>
    <div class="face">
    </div>
    <p class="facts">
      <i>Velociraptor</i> is the genus name of several species of dromaeosaurid dinosaur, the type of dinosaur that is most closely related to birds. Velociraptors are approximately 80 cm tall, and 2 m long, including tail. They usually have a mass of around 24 to 27 kg, although exceptional individuals have grown up to 35 kg.
    </p>
    <p class="facts">
      A velociraptor has one three-inch-long claw on its hind foot and three curved claws on each of its forelimbs. While the velociraptor's claws are not sharp enough to fully disembowel a human, they are sufficient for stabbing and tearing out throats.
    </p>
    <p class="facts">
      Being entirely feathered, and being about the size of a turkey, velociraptors give the overall impression of being very strange-looking birds. Flocks of velociraptors have been mistaken for wild game birds from afar, much to the dismay of the human watching them or, god forbid, mistakenly trying to hunt them.

    <h2>
      Hunting Techniques
    </h2>
      <div class="hunt">
      </div>
    <p class="skills">
      Velociraptors, contrary to popular belief, are not pack hunters. They are sometimes solitary, usually hunting in groups of two or three at most. They are ambushers, preferring to surprise their prey by jumping onto them and slashing at their throat and abdomen, then leaving them to die from blood loss and organ failure.
    </p>
    <p class="skills">
      Their top speed is approximately 60 kph, or 37 mph, although they do not have much stamina and, similar to a cheetah, will exhaust their energy within a few minutes. Velociraptors can also jump up to 10 feet vertically.
    </p>
    <p class="skills">
      Velociraptors have incredible strength in their arms relative to their size, and are capable of exerting enough force to pry open car and house windows. A velociraptor can also break a window by launching itself at the glass, given that the window is large enough. They have yet to master the art of opening doorknobs.
