    ABOUT THE VELOCIRAPTOR
  </h1>
  <p class="aboutintro">
    In order to properly comprehend the threat of a velociraptor, one must first understand the workings of the velociraptor itself. Here are some facts about and skills of the velociraptor.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Basic Facts
  </h2>

  <p class="facts">
    <i>Velociraptor</i> is the genus name of several species of dromaeosaurid dinosaur, the type of dinosaur that is most closely related to birds. Velociraptors are approximately 80 cm tall, and 2 m long, including tail. They usually weigh around 15 to 17 kg, although exceptional individuals have grown up to 35 kg.
  </p>
  <p class="facts">
    Being entirely feathered, velociraptors have the overall impression of a very strange-looking bird. Flocks of velociraptors have been mistaken for wild turkeys from afar, much to the dismay of the human watching them.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Skills
  </h2>
  <p class="skills">
    Velociraptors have three deeply curved claws on each of their forelimbs, and one three-inch-long claw on its hind foot. While velociraptor claws are not sharp enough to fully disembowel a human, they are sufficient for tearing open vital organs in the throat. The velociraptors know this, and the throat is where they will attack first if hunting.
  </p>
  <p class="skills">
    Their top speed is approximately 60 kph, or 37 mph, although they do not have much stamina and, similar to a cheetah, will exhaust their energy within a few minutes. If you have a good head start, you may be able to outrun a velociraptor, although if you are close by you will not make it. Velociraptors can also jump up to 10 feet vertically. Your second story windows are not safe.
