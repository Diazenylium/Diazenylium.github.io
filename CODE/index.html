		<h1>WHEN RAPTORS ATTACK</h1>
		<h3>An Informative Guide</h3>

<p class="intro">
	In our modern society of robbery, murder, assault, and other human-perpetrated crime, we often neglect the attacks of other species. Save the ophiophobic or arcotophobic, most urban or even suburban dwellers will have little fear of bears or snakes if they are sitting within their homes. We treat our houses and workplaces and supermarkets as though they were fortresses, safe from any siege by Mother Nature and her scaled, feathered, and furred minions. 
</p>
<p class="intro">
	But such is not the case. Almost 100% of the population lives in oblivion of the danger of velociraptor attacks. Velociraptors are a kind of small, bipedal dinosaur, not dissimilar in size to a large turkey. They hunt in packs of six to ten, and are capable of terrifying feats of agility. A velociraptor is easily able to pry open car and house windows with the three claws on its forelimb, and is able to smash windows.

<p class="purpose">
As this upstanding citizen demonstrates, all inhabitants of non-velociraptor-proofed homes should be aware of their vulnerability to raptor attacks. With this site, we aim to educate the public on the very real peril of the velociraptor.

No one is safe.
