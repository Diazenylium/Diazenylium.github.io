  <h1>DEFENSE AGAINST VELOCIRAPTORS</h1>
  <p class="defint">Velociraptors, if hungry, will not hesitate to attack a human. We are more than small enough to be brought down by a pack of them, and we don't have scales, thick hides, horns, or particularly sharp teeth. If you are in an area where velociraptor attacks have been reported, please take the following precautions.

  <p class="outdoors">
    If you are walking outside in an area when raptor attacks are regularly reported, <i>be on your guard.</i> Velociraptors, like their avian hawk descendents, are experts at tracking and ambushing prey without being noticed. You are not an exception to this stealth. When in raptor territory, walk loudly and try to make yourself seem like a larger animal than you are. While raptors are proficient in taking down larger prey, they cannot hunt very large animals and are sensible enough not to.
  </p>
  <p class="outdoors">
    Otherwise, you may have to confront the raptors. They are excellent at hunting in groups, and will most likely have you surrounded if they begin to attack. At this point, your best option is to run. Playing dead will not help; velociraptors are both hunters and scavengers. Velociraptors are not very large, and a swift kick will likely suffice to incapacitate one. Your aim is to clear a path through the raptors and run to the nearest shelter. If you cannot see a shelter in sight, locate the nearest climbable tree and attempt to climb as high up as you can. While raptors can jump 10 feet into the air, tree climbing is not their strong suit. If you are out of jumping range then you are probably safe. While you wait out the raptors that are at the base of your tree, you should locate the nearest shelter and make your way towards it once the velociraptors leave.
